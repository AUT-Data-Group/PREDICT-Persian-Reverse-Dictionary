# PREDICT: Persian Reverse Dictionary
A reverse dictionary takes a description of a concept as input, and produces the most appropriate word matching that description. Over the past decades, researchers have designed reverse dictionaries for many languages including English, Turkish, French, and Japanese. This repository contains the implementation details and source codes used for the development of the first intelligent Persian reverse dictionary (called "PREDICT"). 

# Project Files

All of the files needed to run the jupyter notebooks are uploaded on Google Drive, and are accessible through [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OzVUPS9dv3YlaVodm47cjuDl9ojiFzM7?usp=sharing).

# Dataset

We have introduced a novel dataset which can be used to develop Persian reverse dictionaries in the future. The dataset is a collection of 855217 words along with the phrases describing them. These phrases were extracted from the top three most well-known Persian dictionaries (including Amid, Moeen, and Dehkhoda), Persian Wikipedia, and a Persian Wordnet (called [Farsnet](http://farsnet.sbu.ac.ir).
